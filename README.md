# the_necromancers_grip

This is a personal project for my Boot.dev course. It is a simple sidescrolling fighting game made with Pygame where you play as a rogue traveling through a graveyard to fight the necromancer that has taken up residence in the mausoleum, whose power is wreaking havoc on the rest of the deceased.

## Features:
- Two background images
- Two enemy types
- One consumable item
- Idle, run, damage, death, and attack animations for each unit
- All artwork created by the developer
- **No audio** (as I do not have a DAW to create any)
