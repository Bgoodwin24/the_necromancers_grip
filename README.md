# the_necromancers_grip

This is a personal project for my Boot.dev course. It is a simple sidescrolling fighting game made with pygame where you play as a rogue traveling through a graveyard to fight the necromancer that has taken up residence in the mausoleum, whose power is wreaking havoc on the rest of the deceased. There are two background images, two enemy types, one consumable, one attack type per unit, there's one idle/run/damage/death/attack animation for each unit. All artwork was created by myself, there's no audio as I don't have a DAW to create any.

I will update this line once the programming is done with how to clone and play this. :)
